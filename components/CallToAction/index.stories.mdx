# Call to Action

The `Call to Action` is the primary way to grab your users attention and move them to the next stage of their user journey

They can come in many forms depending on the situation. This is the most common version.

<Preview withToolbar>
  <Story name="Default" args={mocks.default}>
    {(args) => <DefaultCTA {...args} />}
  </Story>
  <div />
</Preview>

<ArgsTable story="Default" />

## With Image

A simple 2 col CTA that allows an image

<Preview withToolbar>
  <Story name="With Image" args={mocks.withImage}>
    {(args) => <ImageCTA {...args} />}
  </Story>
  <div />
</Preview>

<ArgsTable story="With Image" />

## Small

The Small Call to Action is to be used to follow up another section where a CTA might not fit naturally within that section.

A good example might be [Features](http://localhost:8888/?path=/docs/sections-features--2-col)

<Preview withToolbar>
  <Story name="Small" args={mocks.default}>
    {(args) => <SmallCTA {...args} />}
  </Story>
  <div />
</Preview>

<ArgsTable story="Small" />

## Approach

Sometimes it makes sense to provide additional information to go with the Call to Action. In this case, we use it to display
our approach, which are shown like features but have costings built in

<Preview withToolbar>
  <Story name="Approach" args={mocks.approach}>
    {(args) => <ApproachCTA {...args} />}
  </Story>
  <div />
</Preview>

<ArgsTable story="Approach" />

# Platforms

A special CTA used for showing all the different platforms we work with. The design is completely custom and it doesn't have

Platforms can be set from within the CMS by creating custom "Platforms". We expect platforms to have one of these types `"Frontend Framework", "Marketing CMS", "Ecommerce"` so they can be correctly sorted in this component

<Preview withToolbar>
  <Story name="Platforms" args={mocks.platforms}>
    {(args) => <PlatformsCTA {...args} />}
  </Story>
  <div />
</Preview>

<ArgsTable story="Platforms" />

# Team

Showcase the team members who worked on a project, service, feature or something else

<Preview withToolbar>
  <Story name="Team" args={mocks.team}>
    {(args) => <TeamCTA {...args} />}
  </Story>
  <div />
</Preview>

<ArgsTable story="Team" />
