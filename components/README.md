## Important Components Info

Components have been imported from Next.js starter repository.

Most components in this directory will need converting into Vue components, instead of React components.

# How-to

To convert the components in this directory, change the .js file extension name to .vue

Inside the component it will need to follow the Vue component structure: Template, Script, Style. However, if using TailwindCSS, the Style tag is redundant as Tailwind utility classes will be added to elements inside Template.
